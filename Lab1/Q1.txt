Question 1.1

The output is not always the same. The order in which the parent and child print can vary after the fork. Also the PIDs change, obviously.

The values that the child process and the parent process print for my_value never change. The parent prints 42 and the child prints 18951. This is because each process has its own copy of the memory. Changing a variable in the child process does not affect the parent process in any way
and vice versa.
