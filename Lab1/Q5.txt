5.1:
There is no significant difference between the output of 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1.
However, in terms of speed, shared memory is faster. Even though it requires more coordination in the communication.


5.2: They are useful for fast, zero-copy sharing of data between processes.
And thus they are a good candidate when we need good performance and in scenarios without tendency to have synchronization problems.
