4.1:
There is no significant difference between the execution results of 3.1 and 4.1.
Pipes are good for scenarios where communication is unidirectional between only 2 processes.
If more processes are involved in the communication or messages are sent in more than one direction a message queue is the right choice.

4.2:
If a master process sends messages to a group of workers instead of a specific worker a message queue can be used.
The master process is not interested in who receives the message and performs corresponding work but wants someone to receive it.
Afterwards the results can also be returned via the same queue if needed.
