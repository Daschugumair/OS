Question 2.1

The output differs for the 100 runs. Apart from the changing PIDs, the value for my_value in the parents thread can be 42 or 18951. Additionally the order of the child and parent output is changing.

The processes in task 1 have distinct address spaces. Here both threads use the same address space and therefore see changes on global data. The child always prints 18951 because it changes 'my_value' itself and then prints it. But depending on the scheduling the child will sometimes change it before the parent reads it and sometimes afterwards. That's why the value printed by the parent thread differs for many executions.
